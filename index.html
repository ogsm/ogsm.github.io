	<h1>Hi there, I'm Abdulwaheed Ògúnsàmì!</h1>
	<p>I'm best known as Abu A'isha. Father of three homeschoolers and a 3rd year PhD student at the Australian National University in Canberra. I study the physics of the shallow part of the earth. <a href="/about"> You can read more about my life...</a></p> </div><!-- /.blurb -->
<p> I am a PhD candidate at  The Australian National University. I study  the physics of shallow earth in the Research School of Earth Sciences. Currently, I am developing an intensive laboratory  understanding for  seismic signature of fluids in cracked media.  I do this with broadband investigation  of seismic properties of dry and fluid saturated  real and proxy crustal materials – such as  rocks, sintered beads and cracked glass.

<p>You can also take a look at my previous/current research and contact me if you find it interesting.

<p>If you cannot find what you are looking for, check out the websites of my colleagues here at RSES, at Colorado School of Mines and at Khalifa University, United Arab Emirates. 
 
<p>Should any of the following interest you, please get in touch 

<p>-	want to collaborate on interesting research ideas for reservoir rock physics or characterisation.
<p>-	want to discuss history, politics or potential economic opportunities in Africa, especially Nigeria
<p>-	want to know more about homeschooling while  PhDing
<p>-	You are an old friend or will like to be make a new one
