	<h1>Hi there, I'm Abdulwaheed Ògúnsàmì!</h1>
	<p>I'm best known as Abu A'isha. Father of three homeschoolers and a 3rd year PhD student at the Australian National University in          Canberra. I study the physics of the shallow  earth in the Research School of Earth Sciences, RSES.  
		
        <p> I am currently developing an intensive laboratory  understanding for  seismic signature of fluids in cracked media.  I do this         with broadband investigation  of seismic properties of dry and fluid saturated  real and proxy crustal materials – such as  rocks,         sintered beads and cracked glass. <a href="/about"> You can read more about my life...</a></p> </div><!-- /.blurb --> . 
        <p>You can also take a look at my previous/current research and contact me if you find it interesting.

        <p>If you cannot find what you are looking for, check out the websites of my colleagues here at RSES, at Colorado School of Mines         and at Khalifa University, United Arab Emirates. 
 
       <p>Should any of the following interest you, please get in touch 

       <p>-want to collaborate on interesting research ideas for reservoir rock physics or characterisation.
       <p>-want to discuss history, politics or potential economic opportunities in Africa, especially Nigeria
       <p>-want to know more about homeschooling while  PhDing
       <p>-You are an old friend or will like to be make a new one
