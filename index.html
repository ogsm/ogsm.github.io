	<h1>Hi there, I'm Abdulwaheed Ògúnsàmì!</h1>
	<p>I'm best known as Abu A'isha. Father of three homeschoolers and a 3rd year PhD student at the Australian National University in Canberra. I study the physics of the shallow part of the earth. <a href="/about"> You can read more about my life...</a></p> </div><!-- /.blurb -->
<p> I am a PhD candidate at  The Australian National University. I study  the physics of shallow earth in the Research School of Earth Sciences. Currently, I am developing an intensive laboratory  understanding for  seismic signature of fluids in cracked media.  I do this with broadband investigation  of seismic properties of dry and fluid saturated  real and proxy crustal materials – such as  rocks, sintered beads and cracked glass. 
<a href="/about"> You can read more about my life...</a></p> </div><!-- /.blurb --> . You can also take a look at my previous/current research and contact me if you find it interesting.

If you cannot find what you are looking for, check out the websites of my colleagues here at RSES, at Colorado School of Mines and at Khalifa University, United Arab Emirates.
